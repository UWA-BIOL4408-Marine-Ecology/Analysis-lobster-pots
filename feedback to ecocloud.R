Too many buttons to press to start an RStudio server - I want a "My favourites" short cut button.


here::here() - is really useful when sharing reproducible research - 
  but we found the here() function does not work consistently across different students when logged into the RStudio server on ecocloud.
 - I think that does not make sense - but weird - be great if it could work consistently.
